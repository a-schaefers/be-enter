* What's this?
I made this quick little bash script because I wanted the ability to:

  - create, mount and chroot new boot environments automatically (utilizing the Linux beadm port or zedenv)
  - optionally use bind mounts
  - umount with the option to immediately activate the boot environment and reboot.

Personally, I use this script to safely automate my workflow. I typically run my personal
[[https://github.com/a-schaefers/dotfiles/blob/gentoo/root-scripts/update-gentoo][update-gentoo]] script inside the chroot, and then reboot into the latest Gentoo.

Here's a proof of concept:
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
root ~ # be-enter test
Boot environment doesn't exist test.

test doesn't exist! create test now? (Y or N) y
** creating boot environment "test" ...
** updating bootloader ...  # honestly the output is much noisier than this. ;)

(chroot) # ./update-gentoo  # (run my gentoo automation script)
(chroot) # rm -rf /         # run experimental command
(chroot) # exit
logout

activate and reboot into "test" NOW? (Y or N) n

root ~ # # ZFS Rocks o/
root ~ #
#+END_SRC

In the above example, had "test" already existed, it would've simply mounted and chrooted-- no questions asked.
If you provide no name at all and simply type "be-enter", it will generate a name using the value of
$BE_NAME_AUTO.

* How it works
Configure three variables at the top of the script:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
# beadm or zedenv to be used for create/mount ?
BE_TOOL="zedenv"

# boot environment name format used if not given explicitly via $1
BE_NAME_AUTO="GENTOO-17.1-$(date +%Y%m%d%H%M)"

# [optional] bind mounts array - specify directories to be shared between host and chroot.
# e.g if portage or ccache live on a separate datset
# BIND_MOUNTS=("/usr/portage" "/gentoo/ccache")
#+END_SRC

* Requirements
be-enter is written for Linux in bash and requires a working zfs-on-root installation
with zedenv and / or beadm already installed.

* Compatibility
be-enter is tested with the following version of beadm:
https://github.com/TemptorSent/beadm

and of course zedenv:
https://github.com/johnramsden/zedenv

* Tips and Tricks
** Change root's PS1 to be chroot-aware
I recommend placing the following line in root's .bashrc to automatically see the prompt is chroot'ed.

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
if [ "$(stat -c %d:%i /)" != "$(stat -c %d:%i /proc/1/root/.)" ]; then export PS1="(chroot) $PS1"; fi
#+END_SRC

** Even if you don't use zedenv
I still recommend installing it and using
zedenv-grub so that you may have nicely generated menuentries for each boot environment.

* Debug
zedenv and beadm leave behind empty directories after unmounting,
and will cause be-enter to fail if they are not removed. be-enter
tries to work around this, but doesn't bend over backwards.
