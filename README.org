I made this quick little bash script because I wanted to:

- create, mount and chroot new boot environments automatically (utilizing the Linux beadm port or zedenv)
- optionally use bind mounts
- umount with the option to immediately activate the boot environment and reboot.

It requires a working zfs-on-root installation with working zedenv or beadm scripts already installed.

Tested with the following version of beadm:
https://github.com/TemptorSent/beadm

and of course zedenv:
https://github.com/johnramsden/zedenv

Even if you don't use zedenv, I still recommend installing it and using
zedenv-grub so that you may have nicely generated menuentries for each boot environment.

I recommend placing the following line in root's .bashrc to automatically see the prompt is chroot'ed.

if [ "$(stat -c %d:%i /)" != "$(stat -c %d:%i /proc/1/root/.)" ]; then export PS1="(chroot) $PS1"; fi
